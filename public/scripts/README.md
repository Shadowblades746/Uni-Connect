A folder for scripts.  
**Scripts should only be small, and should not be required for the page to function correctly.**  
***As per the module github page, javascript code will not be marked, and so only basic scripts to make the system look prettier should be written using js.***  
***Only use js if it is not possible to do the same thing using ruby!***
