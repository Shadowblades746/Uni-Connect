# UniConnect - COM1001 Team Project - Team 18

## Overview
UniConnect is a web application designed to connect university students with mentors. It allows second-year and above students to register as mentors, while first-year students are mentees.

### Key Features:
- **Mentee Application**: First-year students can apply for mentorship with available mentors, providing a bio and personal information for mentors to review.
- **Profile Management**: Both mentors and mentees can manage their personal profiles, including their bio, profile picture, and other details.
- **Mentor Approval**: Mentors can accept or deny mentee requests. Once matched, they can view each other's profiles and communicate.
- **Admin Controls**: Admin users have full control of the platform, including approving or rejecting mentor-mentee matches, setting global limits on the number of mentees per mentor, managing user roles, and deleting or flagging users.
- **Notifications & Requests**: Users receive notifications for new mentor-mentee requests, profile updates, and other system activities.

The platform is designed to simplify the mentor-mentee relationship by making it easy for students to connect, apply, and manage their profiles. Admins can ensure the platform runs smoothly by overseeing the interactions and managing user data.
