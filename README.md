## Ruby Gems
Codio ***should*** be pre-setup with all of the required gems to run the application, however other devices may not already have them installed.  
The project provides a gemfile listing all of the gems required to run the application.    
To make sure your system has all of the required gems installed for the application to run, execute the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
bundle install
```
Make sure to do this before trying to run the application, to make sure the system is setup correctly.
## Running RSpec Tests
The suite of RSpec tests that have been written for application can be run by
 running the following from the root directory of the application.
 ```bash
 rspec .
 ```
## Running The Application
Depending on whether you are using Codio or another device to run 
the application, a different command will be required.  
The commands should be run from the root directory of the project.
### Codio
```bash
sinatra
```
### Other Devices
```bash
ruby app.rb
```

# Info For Developers 
## Git Info 

### Clone Repository 
```bash
git clone git@git.shefcompsci.org.uk:com1001-2024-25/team18/project.git
```

### How to use Branches 
Branches make it easier to collaborate on different things at the same time. 
When you create a branch, you are able to push to gitlab without affecting the main repository. 
This means that if you have a problem, you can more easily ask people about it without having to be in person.

#### Creating a new branch
```bash
git branch branch_name
``` 
#### Switching to your new branch
```bash
git checkout branch_name
``` 
#### Pushing your new branch to gitlab
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin branch_name
``` 

#### Merging
When your ready to merge your branch with 'main', go to the 'merge requests' tab in git lab.
